- PARSE-TIMESTRING works fine, but we need a more human-friendly parser that
  can handle stuff like "08/03/2006 1:54pm CST". or maybe not? see
  http://chaitanyagupta.com/lisp/chronicity/

- Support for other notational systems than the Gregorian

- Ideally, local-time should have everything that the ruby Date class does,
  as well as the time functions in the venerable and honored clsql library.
  This may be a tall order.

- Integrate local-time with http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-l10n/
  Also drop time/timezone related functionality from cl-l10n.

- Make local-time work with olsen timezone rules
  Right now, we're using zic compiled files, which have a limited
   scope.  They may also be larger than the corresponding rule files.

- Support timespecs
